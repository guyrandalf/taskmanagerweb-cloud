## Overview

As a software engineer, I’m documenting my development process to build scalable web applications. I created a task management web dashboard where users can log in/out with session checks in local storage, view and complete tasks also from local shorage with strike-through indicators and toast alerts, and add new tasks, all with a responsive UI styled using custom CSS. My purpose is to strengthen my web development skills with NextJS 15 and prepare for future modules like Cloud Databases.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my editor, with TypeScript for type safety and NextJS 15 for the framework. I managed dependencies with npm, used Git/GitHub for version control, and tested the app in the browser with responsive design adjustments.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
